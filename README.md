# Comic Generator App

Welcome to the Comic Generator app! This application allows you to easily create comics by inputting text for each panel and generating corresponding images using a text-to-image API.

## User Interface:

- The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.
- Utilize the form provided to input text for each of the 10 comic panels.
- A display area is available to showcase the generated comic panels.
- The application is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.

## API Integration:

- To generate images, the app integrates with a text-to-image API.
- Make sure to use the provided API key for authentication.
- Handle API responses gracefully, displaying the generated images in their respective panels.

## Error Handling and Rate Limiting:

- Implement robust error handling mechanisms to provide user feedback for failed API calls or internal errors.
- Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of the text-to-image API and ensure a smooth user experience.
- For an enhanced user experience, consider adding the ability to include speech bubbles or text annotations on the generated images.
- This feature allows users to add more context or humor to their comics.
